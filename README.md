## 💡 Challenges & How I Overcame Them  

One of the main challenges I faced was integrating the frontend with the backend and making sure the CRUD operations worked smoothly for the admin dashboard. I overcame this by breaking the problem into smaller steps, testing each API endpoint with Postman first, and then connecting them to React components.  

Another challenge was handling user authentication and making sure that only logged-in users could access certain pages, while the admin had extra permissions. I solved this by carefully managing tokens and protecting routes in both frontend and backend.  
 

Finally, designing the website to be **responsive and visually appealing** across different devices required careful CSS adjustments and testing on mobile and desktop screens. Overall, breaking problems into smaller steps and testing each part thoroughly helped me overcome these challenges.
